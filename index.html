        <h1>My First Website!</h1>
        <h2>And how I feel about it</h2>
    <p class="intropara">Hi, everybody! I'm so excited to be making my first ever website! Wellll, it's more like my second website, back in grade 7 I made a website about books. Anyways, here's a picture about boardwalks: </p>

    <p>I'm happy to be learning techie stuff. I feel like a real woman in <abbr title="Science, Technology, Engineering and Math">STEM</abbr>. Here are some of my favourite things, besides being a new woman in STEM:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Singing, dancing and acting</li>
        <li>Debate and model UN</li>
        <li>Doing actual journalism work (especially annoying famous journalists. I think Peter Mansbridge is my homie. He almost certainly does not agree)</li>
        <li>Dressing like I stepped out of a 90s movie/The Matrix (which is also a 90s movie) </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Next I will be linking to the Perchance Theatre website, since I worked for them last year and I think more people should know they exist:</p>
    <a href="https://www.perchancetheatre.com">Check them out here!</a>
    <p>Last but not least I will be adding Bo Burnham's "That Funny Feeling", because it is a very good song and makes me very sad:</p>
